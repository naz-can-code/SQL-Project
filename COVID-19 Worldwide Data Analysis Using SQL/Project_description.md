## **COVID-19 Worldwide Data Analysis Using SQL**

### **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data using **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to uncover meaningful insights about the pandemic’s impact across countries and continents. The dataset includes information on **confirmed cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population**, allowing a comprehensive examination of trends and patterns.

The objective of this project is to transform raw data into actionable insights by answering critical questions about infection rates, mortality, and vaccination progress around the world.

### **Purpose**

The main purpose of this analysis is to:

* Understand the **severity and spread** of COVID-19 across different regions.
* Identify **countries and continents most affected** by infections and deaths.
* Examine the **effectiveness of vaccination efforts** globally.
* Demonstrate the use of **SQL for real-world data analysis** and public health research.

---

### **Tools and Techniques**

The project was completed entirely using **SQL**, applying a range of advanced querying techniques, including:

* **Aggregate Functions** – for calculating totals, averages, and rates.
* **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **Temporary Tables** – for organizing complex queries.
* **Window Functions** – to compute running totals and rolling averages.
* **Joins** – to merge data from multiple tables (COVID deaths and vaccinations).
* **Views** – to store query results for reporting, visualization, and future analysis.

### **Key Insights and Analysis**

Through a series of SQL queries, the analysis explored the following areas:

* **Mortality Rate:** Calculated the percentage of deaths relative to total cases to evaluate the virus’s severity across regions.
* **Population Infection Percentage:** Determined what portion of each country’s population was infected to assess spread intensity.
* **Highest Infection Rate:** Identified countries with the highest infection rate in proportion to their population.
* **Highest Death Rate:** Highlighted countries with the greatest death rate relative to their total population.
* **Total Death Count by Country and Continent:** Revealed which regions experienced the highest cumulative fatalities.
* **Global Daily Trends:** Analyzed daily new cases and deaths to understand pandemic progression and fluctuations over time.
* **Vaccination Progress:** Measured daily and cumulative vaccination rates to determine how much of each population was immunized.

---

### **Meaningful Outcomes**

The analysis provided:

* A clear picture of **which regions were most impacted** by COVID-19.
* Insight into **the relationship between infection, death, and vaccination rates**.
* Data-driven evidence to support **public health decision-making** and **resource allocation**.
* A demonstration of how SQL can be leveraged for **data exploration, trend detection, and analytical reporting**.

### **Conclusion**

This project showcases how SQL can be used as a powerful analytical tool for global health data. By transforming raw COVID-19 statistics into structured insights, it enhances understanding of pandemic dynamics and supports informed policy and public health responses. The methodology and queries developed can be extended for future analyses or integrated into dashboards for visualization and monitoring.
